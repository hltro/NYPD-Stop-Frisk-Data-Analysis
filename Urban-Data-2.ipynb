The interpretation of the signs of coefficients of linear regression is similar to that of logistic regression in that: positive coefficients indicate that a variable is associated with greater values of the output, and negative coefficients indicate that a variable is associated with smaller values. Both \"black\" and \"hispanic\" are positively correlated with \"frisked\", and \"white\" is negatively correclated with \"frisked\". The interpretation of coefficients is slightly different. For linear regression, with a unit increase of independent variable, the dependent variable increases the amount of the coefficient. \n",

The logistic regression is better when comparing different groups based on a categorical outcome, while the linear regression is better when observing how a set of independent features correlate to an outcome. In this case, the logistic regression would be a better choice because being frisked or not is a binary outcome."

When using many machine learning models, including regularized logistic regression, it is important to preprocess the input features so they are all on the same scale, for reasons discussed in class.

Use sklearn's StandardScaler (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html) to fit a scaling transform on the train set and transform the train set (you can use the fit_transform method on the train set).Then apply the fitted StandardScaler model to the validation and test sets as well (using the transform --- not the fit --- method).

        "**g. Assess model *calibration* on the test set. This checks whether the model's predicted probabilities line up with the true probabilities, and is important to assess here because we will be analyzing the model's predicted probabilities. To assess calibration, take the 10% of rows of the test set with the highest model predictions and compare the mean model predicted probability (ie, the output of `predict_proba`) to the actual mean of the outcome variable. Repeat for the next 10% of rows, and for all 10% groups. Make a plot comparing the model predicted probabilities on each 10% group to the actual outcomes (mean predicted probability on the x-axis and mean actual outcome on the y-axis). You should end up with a plot with 10 points, one for each 10% group. Plot the line y=x so you can see how well the predicted probabilities line up with the actual probabilities - ideally, your points will lie on the line or close to it. (10 points)**\n",

        "This graph is evidence for Fourteenth Amendment violations (racial discrimination) for the following reasons: <br>\n",
        "1) No matter if the threshold is 2% or 5%, White pedestrians have a much lower rate of being stopped and frisked compared to other populations. When we look closely at the 2% threshold, all three other races have almost double or triple the fraction of being stopped, showing that the police's decision to stop and frisk is highly racially motivated and biased towards White population. <br>\n",
        "2) As the threshold value increases, the line for White pedestrains increases at a much slower rate compared to Black and Hispanic populations. This indicates that even as the probability of finding a weapon becomes higher, police is still less inclined to stop White population and more willing to stop Black, Hispanic, and Asian population.

        "1) The authors of the paper found out that in \"43% of the CPW stops between 2011 and 2012, there was only 1% chance of finding a weapon on the suspect\", suggesting that individuals were often stopped with little evidence of criminal activity. <br>\n",
        "2) Black and Hispanics were disproportionately involved in low hit rate stops compared to Whites, even after correcting for factors such as highly localized policing tactics. <br>\n",
        "3) The authors suggest that one can \"recover 50% of weapons by conducting only the 6% of CPW stops with the highest ex ante hit rate, and 90% of weapons by conducting 58% of CPW stops\". They also developed a set of stop heuristics that can help police officers achieve such statistical efficacy via a simple scoring rule."
